    "PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposals. Check them out [here](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/)! We'll start by talking about PEP8, which is the Style Guide for Python code. This discusses many points which are also important for collaboration. Git, the version control system you dealt with a bit so far and Github, the website that hosts this system, is useful for sharing and integrating code bases, but if code is poorly written it can still be cryptic and difficult to decipher. By following styling guidelines such as those outlined in PEP8, we can all create more legible code that can be shared in a streamlined fashion."
